\section{Lower Atmospheric Signatures in a Solar Flare Associated with Seismicity}


%\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Background}
Sunquakes represent the propagation of acoustic waves in the sub-photosphere, responding to an excitation of the photosphere during the impulsive phase of solar flares. The progenitors of sunquakes are thought to be either shocks, radiative backwarming, direct proton collision or sudden magnetic field reconfiguration, see Section \ref{sunprog}. Each of these mechanisms relies on the transport of energy from the corona to the photosphere, and the physical conditions existing in the chromosphere such as magnetic field configuration and plasma density. To understand sunquakes and their relationship to solar flares, we need to understand how energy moves down through the solar atmosphere and the physical conditions that are present. \\

The majority of the energy released by a flare is deposited in the lower solar atmosphere and manifests itself in the form of enhanced hard X-ray, UV and optical radiation. During the impulsive phase of a solar flare, energy in the form of energetic particles, shocks and MHD waves flow along newly formed coronal magnetic loops, down through the stratified solar atmosphere. As energy is deposited through the differing environments of each atmospheric layer, telltale emission signatures are released. Hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints are observed due to the excitation of the chromosphere by energetic particle beams accelerated by coronal magnetic reconnection during the flare \citep{1995ApJ...455..347A}. According to the standard flare model \citep{1964NASSP..50..451C, 1966Natur.211..695S, 1974SoPh...34..323H, 1976SoPh...50...85K} magnetic reconnection in the corona leads to energy being directed downward in the form of particles, radiation, MHD waves and conduction of heat, which in turn produces ultra-violet (UV) ribbons in the chromosphere. This means that HXR footpoints and UV ribbons observed in the chromosphere directly map to the reconfiguring magnetic field during the flare. When energy is deposited at lower altitudes such as the photosphere, emission becomes visible in the optical, known as a white light flare (WLF). The processes governing WLF emission in the lower solar atmosphere are detailed by \cite{2007ASPC..368..417D} whereby two main mechanisms are highlighted; Balmer/Paschen continuum emission produced via hydrogen recombination in the lower chromosphere; and enhancement of photospheric continuum emission due to heating of the temperature minimum region. According to \cite{1989SoPh..124..303M}, Balmer/Paschen emission upward (i.e., directly detected) also has a downward component which leads to impulsive radiative backwarming of the photosphere which in-turn can generate a sunquake.




\subsection{Observations}
The X1 flare of the 29th of March 2014 in active region NOAA 12017, was well observed by RHESSI, IRIS and SDO/HMI, collecting HXR, UV and optical emission respectively (see Figure \ref{saxcontours-vert}). The impulsive phase of the flare occurs at 17:46 UT, at which point all mentioned instruments provide good coverage. RHESSI captured hard x-ray data throughout the flare.%need rhessi: resolution, fov, passbands, dataproduct
 The IRIS spacecraft captured the temporal evolution of the flare between 14:09 and 17:54 UT via it's slit-jaw imager and spectrograph instruments at solar coordinates of 491", 282" with a spatial resolution of 0.1667" per pixel. The slit-jaw imager data provides coverage of a field of view spanning 167" by 174", of passbands that including 1403, 2796 and 2832 \AA\ at 26, 19 and 75 second cadence respectively. The spectrograph slit is aligned directly over chromospheric flare ribbons, and the sunquake point of origin, with a field of view spanning 14" by 174". The spectrograph slit is exposed for $\sim9$ seconds at 8 slit locations for a total of 72 seconds cadence. Wavelengths observed over three channels include FUV1: 1331.7 - 1358.4 \AA, FUV2: 1389.0 - 1407.0 \AA\ and NUV: 2782.7 - 2851.1 \AA, associated with the upper-chromosphere down to the upper-photosphere. Spectral lines include C II, Si IV and Mg II h and k. IRIS data is the standard level 2 data product provided for scientific research, which has been calibrated to negate dark currents, flat-field and spacecraft rotational effects. The HMI instrument onboard SDO observed the entire solar photosphere, collecting 6173 \AA\ continuum intensity data throughout the flare event. HMI has a pixel size of 0.6 " providing reasonable spatial resolution at a cadence of 45 seconds. HMI data is calibrated to negate cosmic-rays, dark currents, flat-field and spacecraft rotational effects. A 6mHZ acoustic egression power map, generated via holography techniques, is supplied via private communication by Sergei Zharkov.

\subsection{Analysis}


Using the \verbatim{opsex} software within SolarSoft (SSWIDL), count data from RHESSI is fit to thermal and non-thermal electron energy models. %insert rhessi section from that paper

White light flares are difficult to see against the bright photospheric background therefore to maximise the insight gained from observations of the flaring photosphere, data must be filtered. Photospheric data captured by IRIS MG II wing slit-jaw and SDO HMI continuum observations are subjected to a running difference filter to isolate locations that are white-light enhanced. The running difference filter effectively removes static features leaving behind those pixels that are changing over short time-scales. However, for removing signatures of those processes occurring over shorter time periods such as granulation and p-mode oscillations, this filtering technique is ineffective. This is not a problem, as for the purpose of white light flare analysis, the data yield a strong contrast between flare-enhanced and background pixels after being filtered by a $i-2$ running difference. The next stage is to determine which pixels in the difference image are those that are enhanced during the flare. For the best result, white-light enhanced pixels are identified using a combination of visual inspection and thresholding. Attempts at automating the identification process tend to lead to false positives being triggered by noise or granulation features. IRIS SJIs and SG data have no need for filtering.

\end{figure}

IRIS SJ and SG data are converted from relative intensity (DN per pixel) to energy (erg) units using conversion factors provided in the instrument documentation \citep{}. To perform the same conversion for SDO HMI data required slightly more work as the information was not explicitly presented in the documentation. Using a combination of sources \citep{} the instrument's properties are used to fulfill a conversion factor in the form, $ $.

For the IRIS and SDO HMI data sets, multiple sample points have been chosen based on locations specific to the sunquake and ribbon activity. Studying the flare in this way allows the energy distribution along the ribbon to be analysed and provides a point of comparison for the sunquake location. Each data set has five sample points per ribbon, a procedure which is repeated at two time frames, 17:45 and 17:46, providing twenty individual energy measurements per data set. The number of sample points will likely be increased in the future to provide better spatial resolution for ribbon energy distribution analysis. The problem with defining multiple ribbon samples over five different data sets comes when one considers the morphology of the local magnetic field. Accelerated charged material can only travel along the magnetic field, so the shape of those field lines will dictate the location of emission due to collisions and therefore the morphology of the ribbon itself. With this in mind the sample of coordinates chosen is based on matching common morphological features seen in each data set thereby enhancing the probability of a spatial relationship.

IRIS spectroscopic data is sampled over a wavelength range of 2825.7 and 2825.8\AA\ which is within the Balmer continuum. The SG data is sampled at slit positions in heliocentric coordinates that relate to quake and ribbon locations.

IRIS SJIs of Si IV, Mg II and Mg II wing, as well as IRIS SG Balmer are aligned with HMI continuum and lightcurves are created for pixels at sunquake and ribbon locations (see Figure \ref{}).

An egression map of acoustic power at 6mHz, reveals the position of the sunquake. HXR data from RHESSI and acoustic power data are overlaid on HMI and IRIS slit jaw maps to highlight spatial and temporal evolution of data-sets (see Figure \ref{saxcontours-vert}).\\

\subsection{First Results and Discussion}
%Thoughts:
%1) Is increased density in local plamsa responsible for increased emission: more brem emission or hydrogen recombination?
%2) Although the sample needs to be increased for better statistics, a preliminary study of energy distribution along the ribbons has revealed an imbalance of localised emission.
    %a)Does this mean that the atmospheric plasma is inherently inhomogenous in density?
    %b)or could it be that emission is emanating from slightly different altitudes where by the density gradient is dictated by gravity.
    %c) or could it be that localised regions of greater emission are caused by transient changes in local plasma state by heating from above (heat conduction) causing shock/pressure waves to propagate downward. The shock would however, have a speed that is slower than incoming accelerated particles, which could cause localise changes in emission output.
    %d) Could shock/pressure waves be imaged by taking a high res look at ribbon energy distribution, i.e, look for peaks that correspond in ribbon coords across the different altitudes
        %-could plot x =
%3) why is rhessi peak at 1747, whereas iris and hmi show peak at 1746?

The location of maximum acoustic power, RHESSI HXR, IRIS and SDO intensity correlate both spatially and temporally (see Figure \ref{saxcontours-vert}), showing that energy input into the upper chromosphere somehow propagates down to the photosphere. The sunquake is located directly underneath both maximum HXR and white-light emission.

Intensity lightcurves (see Figure \ref{lcseries-bold}) from SDO and IRIS seem to suggest a similar representation of the movement of energy through the chromosphere to lower altitudes, since their impulsive appearance and peak intensity occur within a minute of each other throughout the different regions. In the transition region above the chromosphere, relative intensity values at both sunquake and ribbon locations increase by three orders of magnitude during the impulsive phase of the flare. The double-peak feature is discussed below. In the chromosphere, relative intensity values at both sunquake and ribbon locations increase by two orders of magnitude during the impulsive phase of the flare. IRIS Balmer light curves for both locations increase by around $100\%$ during the flare indicating the existence of radiative backwarming, however, initial values are very different. Pre-flare Balmer emission in the sunquake location is four times that in the ribbon location, this could indicate that radiative backwarming is more prolific above the sunquake, providing a source of further study. Similarly to the Balmer lightcurves, the upper-photosphere data shows the pre-flare sunquake location intensity to be approximately one order of magnitude greater than in the ribbon. Both locations show an order of magnitude increase in relative intensity during the flare. SDO HMI data from the photosphere shows both sunquake and ribbon data-sets display an order of magnitude increase in intensity during the flare, although it seems that the ribbon location has a larger increase.




IRIS SJI lightcurves converted into $erg.s^{-1}.cm^{-2}.$\AA$^{-1}.sr^{-1}$ show the emission flux increase during the flare. In the transition region above the chromosphere intensity increases by three orders of magnitude, from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ $erg.s^{-1}.cm^{-2}.$\AA$^{-1}.sr^{-1}$, in both sunquake and ribbon locations. When compared to the ribbon plot, the sunquake location displays an interesting double-peak which seems to suggest that there is a preliminary deposition of energy approximately 7 minutes before the onset of the impulsive phase of the flare. The energy deposited and highlighted by the first of the two peaks could provide a means to lower the density in the upper-chromosphere by causing chromospheric material to expand upward and downward. The resulting downward propagating shock wave could leave an easier path for energy transport during the main flare impulse, allowing penetration to deeper atmospheric layers. This is an idea that will be investigated in more detail in the future. In the chromosphere intensity increases by two order of magnitude, from $10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ $erg.s^{-1}.cm^{-2}.$\AA$^{-1}.sr^{-1}$, in both sunquake and ribbon locations. In the upper-photosphere intensity increases by one order of magnitude, from $10^{12}$ to $10^{13}$ $erg.s^{-1}.cm^{-2}.$\AA$^{-1}.sr^{-1}$, in both sunquake and ribbon locations. As described above, pre-flare intensity values differ between the two locations.

Spectroscopic data shown in Figure \ref{spectra} show the sunquake emission to be an order of magnitude greater in amplitude than in the ribbon. The spectrum taken from a non-flaring region is around three orders of magnitude smaller than the sunquake location. This means that the sunquake location is receiving more energy during the flare than both the ribbon and non-flare locations. Lines over the sunquake location are strongly broadened when compared to spectra elsewhere, which could indicate heating or increased pressure in these regions. Ribbon and sunquake spectra appear to be redshifted in comparison to the non-flaring region, showing that there must be material moving down through the chromosphere during the flare.\\


\subsection{Future Work}
In the next three to six months the aim is to have completed the following tasks:
\begin{itemize}

\item Calculate energy associated with emission captured by HMI to compare with the acoustic power of the sunquake.

\item Calculate energy associated with emission captured by IRIS slit jaw and spectrometer in order to estimate energy deposition in the atmosphere.

\item Calculate energy associated with Balmer emission to assess likely energy contribution of radiative backwarming.

\item Calculate non-thermal electron power via HXR spectra to estimate the initial energy of the electron beam accelerated by the corona.


\item A more detailed analysis of IRIS spectroscopic data to estimate velocity, density and temperature of chromospheric material.

\item Analysis of triplet lines in the wings of Mg II h \& k will be used to determine heating of the lower chromosphere as per recent work by \cite{2015arXiv150401733P}.

\item Compare spectroscopic data taken by EIS with that of IRIS.

\item Magnetogram: Look at HMI/SOT data to analyse the configuration of the magnetic field.

\item Learn how to apply local helioseismology techniques to data.
