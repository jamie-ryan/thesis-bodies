\section{Data and Methodology}
%THIS SHOULD DESCRIBE THE SATELLITE DATA AND THE TECHNIQUES USED TO PROCESS AND ANALYSE THESES DATA.
\subsection{Observations}
The X1 flare of the 29th of March 2014 in active region NOAA 12017, was well observed by RHESSI, IRIS and SDO/HMI, collecting HXR, UV and optical emission respectively (see Figure \ref{saxcontours-vert}). The peak of the impulsive phase of the flare occurs at 17:48 UT, at which point all mentioned instruments provide good coverage. 

\subsubsection{RHESSI}
The RHESSI spacecraft is capable of observing a wide range of high energy emission from solar flares, covering soft x-ray to gamma-rays. 
%insert RHESSI background info


RHESSI captured a wide range of high energy emission throughout the flare, see Figure \ref{rhessicft}, however, for this project, only the 10 to 100 keV HXR range are sampled. During the impulsive phase of a flare, high energy x-ray emission is an indicator that accelerated particles are present. Assuming that the chromosphere is a thick target \citep{1971SoPh...18..489B}, the deposition of energy by accelerated particles is due to collisions between charged particles and ions producing hard X-ray bremsstrahlung emission. Using equation \ref{pnth} one can calculate the power, $P$, injected into the atmosphere by non-thermal electrons.  
 
\begin{equation}\label{pnth}
P(E \geq E_{c}) = \int_{E_{C}}^{\infty} EF(E)dE
\end{equation}

The electron distribution $F(E)$ is controlled by the power law $AE^{-\delta}$, where $E$ is the electron energy, $A$ is the total injected electron rate normalisation factor, $E_{C}$ is the low energy cut off and $\delta$ is the electron distribution spectral index. The value of $E_{C}$ represents the upper boundary between thermal and non-thermal energy contributions to the x-ray spectrum. This means that the total energy associated with non-thermal electron power is a lower limit.  Performing the integral in equation \ref{pnth} gives the total non-thermal electron power in the form of equation \ref{pnth1}.

\begin{equation}\label{pnth1}
P(E \geq E_{c}) = \frac{AE_{C}^{(2-\delta)}}{(\delta - 2)}
\end{equation}

Once $P$ has been determined, a total energy can be calculated by multiplying the power by the time period over which the data covers. In this case that would be the impulsive phase of the flare.
  
Practically applying a thick target model fit to RHESSI data is acheived by using the \texttt{ospex} software within SolarSoft (SSWIDL). The entire data set has to be split into short intervals to improve the accuracy of fitting and the detail of resulting plots. The attenuator state of the instrument has to be taken into account due to differences in sensitivity to incoming photons. Therefore it is important to define intervals for fitting first by the attenuator state as \texttt{ospex} will mitigate for the differences in count sensitivity. Then each attenuator time period can be split further in to smaller time increments. Shown in Figure \ref{erhessi} is the resulting fit over the impulsive phase of the flare. At the peak of the impulsive phase between 17:46 and 17:48 the RHESSI fit shows an energy ranging from $1.0{\times}10^{28}$ to $2.5{\times}10^{29}$ erg. Assuming the fitting model is correct then the release of this energy is due to non-thermal electrons being accelerated by magnetic reconnection, depositing their energy into the chromosphere.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{IRIS}
The IRIS spacecraft captured the temporal evolution of the flare between 14:09 and 17:54 UT via it's slit-jaw imager and spectrograph at solar coordinates 491", 282", with a spatial resolution of 0.1667" per pixel. The slit-jaw imager data provides coverage of a field of view spanning 167" by 174", of passbands that including 1403, 2796 and 2832 \AA\ at 26, 19 and 75 second cadence respectively. The spectrograph slit has a field of view spanning 14" by 174" and is aligned directly over chromospheric flare ribbons, and the sunquake point of origin. For the majority of the observation, the spectrograph slit is exposed for $\sim9$ seconds at 8 slit locations for a total of 72 seconds cadence per raster. However, during the impulsive phase the IRIS SG shortens it's exposure time to around 2.4 seconds in order to mitigate against saturation of the CCD. Wavelengths observed over three channels include FUV1: 1331.7 - 1358.4 \AA, FUV2: 1389.0 - 1407.0 \AA\ and NUV: 2782.7 - 2851.1 \AA, associated with the transition region, chromosphere and the upper-photosphere. Spectral lines include C II, Si IV and Mg II h and k. IRIS SJI data is the standard level 2 data product provided for scientific research, which has been calibrated to negate dark currents, flat-field and spacecraft rotational effects. In order to observe flare ribbons in the photospheric data captured by IRIS SJI MG II wing channel, a running difference filter is applyed. This effectively removes unwanted background features, highlighting the UV ribbons. IRIS SG data is manually corrected for changing exposure times and wavelength shifts caused by the orbital motions of the spacecraft. IRIS SG data is sampled over a wavelength range of 2825.7 and 2825.8\AA\ which represents a sample of Balmer pseudo-continuum. The next stage of the processing requires that IRIS SJ and SG data are converted from relative intensity (DN per pixel) to energy (erg) units. This is acheived by using a method provided in the instrument documentation \citep{2014SoPh..289.2733D} which calculates the conversion factors between DN and erg units in SSWIDL. It is then a case of inserting IRIS DN per pixel intensity values into the equation \ref{irisradiometriccal} converting them into energy units. $F_{DN}$ is flux in units of DN per pixel, $C_{d2p}$ is the DN to photon conversion factor, $E_{\lambda}$ is the photon energy and $E_{erg}$ is to put the result into erg units.  

\begin{equation}\label{irisradiometriccal}
E = \frac{F_{DN}  C_{d2p} E_{\lambda}}{E_{erg}}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{SDO HMI}
The HMI instrument onboard SDO observes the entire solar photosphere, collecting 6173 \AA\ (Fe I) continuum intensity data. HMI has 4k resolution with a pixel size relating to 0.505" spatial resolution, with each image having a cadence of 45 seconds. The data is calibrated to negate cosmic-rays, dark currents, flat-field and spacecraft rotational effects. HMI continuum data is used primarily to observe White light flares, which are difficult to see against the bright photospheric background. To highlight the positions of flare ribbons in the photosphere, data must be filtered. Silimarly to \cite{2014ApJ...783...98K}, photospheric continuum data captured by HMI is put through a two stage filtering porcedure. First the data has an unsharp filter applied, $Img_{filtered}=Img-smooth(Img,10), where the function smooth relates to a 10 pixel boxcar smoothing filter, this is to remove small features such as granulation. The technique is not perfect meaning that some granulation is still visible after the unsharp filter. Second, $Img_{filtered}$ is subjected to a running difference filter to isolate locations that are white-light enhanced. The running difference filter effectively removes static features leaving behind those pixels that are changing over short time-scales. However, for removing signatures of those processes occurring over shorter time periods such as the remaining granulation and also p-mode oscillations, this filtering technique is ineffective. This is not a problem, as for the purpose of white light flare analysis, the data yield a strong contrast between flare-enhanced and background pixels after being filtered by a $i-2$ running difference. The next stage is to determine which pixels in the difference image are those that are enhanced during the flare. For the best result, white-light enhanced pixels are identified using a combination of visual inspection and thresholding. Attempts at automating the identification process tend to lead to false positives being triggered by noise or granulation features. \\
HMI Dopplergrams are used in conjunction with holography techniques to produce a 6mHZ acoustic egression power map (supplied via private communication by Sergei Zharkov) revealing the location of the sunquake. 
As with the IRIS data, the next stage of processing is to calculate and energy. To perform the energy conversion for SDO HMI data a combination of sources \citep{2012SoPh..275...41B, 2012SoPh..275..285C} have been used to find the instrument's properties which are used to fulfil a conversion factor in the form of equation \ref{hmiradiometriccal}. Where $g$ is the instrument gain, $QE$ is the quantum efficiency of the charged couple device and $A_{ap}$ is the instrument aperture area, all other terms hold the same meaning as in equation \ref{irisradiometriccal}.

\begin{equation}\label{hmiradiometriccal}
E = \frac{F_{DN} E_{\lambda}}{g QE A_{ap} E_{erg}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data Sampling}
For the IRIS SJI, IRIS SG and SDO HMI data sets, multiple sample points have been chosen based on the moment in time when the IRIS SG slit is directly over the southern flare ribbon and sunquake impact location. These coordinates are sampled across all data sets except RHESSI which has limited spatial resolution. Figure \ref{mgwrib} shows the sample coordinates, RHESSI HXR and the 6mHz sunquake egression map, plotted over IRIS SJI MG II data in an effort to demonstrate the spatial alignment between HXR (particle beam), UV ribbons and sunquake impact. Table \ref{coordtab} shows how each sample number relates to a heliocentric position in arcseconds.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

This project presents a first look at a multi-wavelength energy analysis of the lower solar atmosphere during the 29th of March 2014 X class solar flare. The main focus up to this point has been to acquire energy estimates from the various atmospheric regions in an attempt to assess the likelihood of radiative backwarming as a generation method for the sunquake. The location of maximum acoustic power, RHESSI HXR, IRIS and SDO intensity correlate both spatially and temporally (see Figure \ref{saxcontours-vert}), showing that energy input into the upper chromosphere via accelerated non-thermal electrons propagates down to the photosphere. The sunquake is located directly underneath both maximum HXR and an area of white-light emission.

Energy estimates from RHESSI data show there to be between $1.0{\times}10^{28}$ to $2.5{\times}10^{29}$ erg during the impulsive phase of the flare. Comparing this to the sunquake energy of $1.3\pm0.05{\times}10^{26}$ $erg.s^{-1}$ means that the acoustic energy is well within the energy budget provided by accelerated non-thermal electrons, so how is the energy getting to the photosphere to cause seismic event?

Energy estimates from IRIS are not always useful due to over saturation of the instrument CCD, however, when comparing the ribbon locations to that of the sunquake some clear behaviours reveal themselves. The 1400 \AA\ channel is almost always showing greater radiative energy in all ribbon locations compared to the sunquake. This could be because transition region ribbons are rarely directly above the sunquake epicentre due to magnetic field configuration. The 2796 \AA\ channel becomes saturated slightly less often than the 1400 \AA\, providing more insight. The IRIS 2796 \AA\ channel is less in energy than the sunquake location around 30\% of the time. However, no real comparison can be attained due to the saturation of the CCD at the majority of ribbon pixels and the sunquake pixel. The only information that can be deduced, is that the sunquake pixel has an extraordinary 2796 \AA\ enhancement but then so do the majority of the ribbon locations. Balmer emission calculated from IRIS SG data is consistently of less energy than at the sunquake location, this is an interesting result as it means that there is more radiative backwarming above the sunquake pixel than in any other location sampled. However, the energy required to generate the sunquake is in the order of $10^25$ ergs, which when compared to the $2.68{\times}10^{16}$ erg of energy available in the Balmer pixel is $10^{9}$ times greater! Perhaps radiative backwarming only plays a bit-part in the generation of the sunquake?  
The 2832 \AA\ IRIS channel is harder to summarise due to the fact that comparing ribbon locations to that of the sunquake show that there is a 50:50 chance that the ribbon could have greater or lower energy output.
SDO HMI continuum data is probably the most revealing, in that almost all of the ribbon locations have far greater energy output than the sunquake location. This could be explained by the sunquake being only partially under a white light ribbon. 

In conclusion, this analysis has barely scratched the surface of the information available in the data. Some immediate trends have been noticed such as the lower levels of Balmer and higher levels of photospheric continuum energy in the flare ribbons compared to the sunquake. Is there a connection between these two emission regions, and do these signatures have anything to do with the generation of the sunquake? In general the data sets available are tending to show that there is not enough energy in atmospheric emission to generate the sunquake via radiative backwarming.

  

\subsection{Future Work}
Obviously there is a need for a much more detailed analysis, which will be the main task for the immediate future. Plotting energy behaviours of each ribbon location and data set would help to visualise the trends discussed. There is plans to analyse $\gamma$-ray and magnetogram data to look for signatures associated with direct particle collision and impulsive magnetic field reconfiguration respectively. IRIS SG data will be used to analyse Doppler-shift to look for shock waves.

\subsubsection{In the Last Few Months}
The majority of the work carried out since the last panel meeting has been:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate energy associated with emission captured by HMI to compare with the acoustic power of the sunquake.
\item Calculate energy associated with emission captured by IRIS slit jaw and spectrometer in order to estimate energy deposition in the atmosphere.
\item Calculate energy associated with Balmer emission to assess likely energy contribution of radiative backwarming.
\item Calculate non-thermal electron power via HXR spectra to estimate the initial energy of the electron beam accelerated by the corona.
\end{itemize}
