\subsection{Results and Discussion}
At the peak of the impulsive phase between 17:46 and 17:47 the RHESSI fit shows an energy ranging from $1.0{\times}10^{28}$ to $2.5{\times}10^{29}$ erg. Assuming the fitting model is correct then the release of this energy is due to non-thermal electrons being accelerated and depositing energy into the chromosphere.
