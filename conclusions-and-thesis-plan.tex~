\section{Conclusions and Thesis Plan}

%particle beam conclusions
As inferred from 50 to 100 keV HXR measurements, the impulsive phase of the flare occurs from 17:46 to 17:47. HXR contours and energy curve show that there is a nonthermal electron beam directly over the sunquake. 

The electron beam has/hasn't enough energy to cause the sunquake.

Even with the most idealistic of circun=mstances, the electron beam momentum of $p_e \sim 1.35{\times}10^{17}$ g cm s$^{-1}$ is ... orders of magnitude smaller than that required to produce the sunquake. It is a similar conclusion for the theoretical proton beam momentum of ..., which is ??? times smaller than $p_{sqk}$.

For these reasons it is unlikely that a nonthermal particle beam is capable of producing a sunquake in this event.

%radiative backwarming conclusions
Although there seems to be some radiative backwarming occuring, it is evident from time integrated flux calculations of the Balmer continuum emission that there is insufficient radiative energy to generate the sunquake.
