In my reality, you are my Sun, 

my stars, my moon, 

my sink point in my space and time.

A life without you would be like, 

a solar system with no sun, 

an atom with no nucleus.

I love you. I love you;

like a nightsky loves the distant twinkling of a billion stars, 

without which, the infinite darkness would reign; 

like the incandescent love of our retinas for the rising and setting sun, 

about a monotonous blue sky;

like the tranquil seas love the tides, 

like the tides love the moon, 

like the moon loves the Earth!

The very fabric of my being is interwoven with yours,  

immeasurable and infinitesimal in scale,

I am nothing, without you my reality would cease to be.
